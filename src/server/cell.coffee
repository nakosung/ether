	# cell can be a room in chat service, a zone in mmorpg world, and so on.
	# cell should be contained in one thread which is running on one node app.
	# this will eliminate all kinds of dirties related with concurrency.

	# all cells of a kind are homogeneous.

	# each cells represent their own domain of the problem.
	# eg) 
	#	cell 1 : chat-room 1, cell 2 : chat-room 2
	# 	cell 1 : world-zone [1,1] cell 2 : world-zone [1,2] 

	# interop among cells should be considered.
	# thus, the interface will be extended to non-user clients. (eg. other cell)

	# to improve network bandwidth and eliminate unnecessary redundancy
	# cells will accelerate muxed publish scheme.

	# FAULT TOLERANCY
	# cell can be dropped or down without a notice
	# latest state of cell may be cached into some kind of db (redis, mongo, ...)
	# so much of cells should remain as stateless.
	# this may help dynamic load balancing with cell-migration support.

	# eg) 
	#	critical persistent info of chat-service : list of participants
	#	critical persistent info of world-zone : list of entities (not activities)

	# TISSUE - CELL
	# A node process can host multiple cells.
